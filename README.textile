h1. Lorenz Attractor for iPhone OS and Mac OS X

This code contains an iPhone, a Mac OS X application and a Mac OS X screensaver using OpenGL ES 1.1, featuring the Lorenz attractor in a 3D space.

h2. Helper

There is a "lorenz" subfolder with a simple C program used to generate the 3D coordinates of the points in the Lorenz attractor. The "build.sh" script compiles, executes and saves the output into a "values.inc" file, later used by the OpenGL view to generate the 3D object.
